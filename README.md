# thomas-holland-showcase

This repo is a personal showcase of small tools and experiments, cleaned up to share.

## What you'll find here
- `projects/`: runnable tools and demos (self-contained and documented)
- `research/`: lightweight notes and architecture explorations

## Featured projects
- `projects/agent-friendly-git-wrapper/`: agent-focused git/gh router that standardizes workflows and trims token-heavy output.

## Benchmarks
Some projects include benchmarks and profiling notes. For example:
- `projects/agent-friendly-git-wrapper/documentation/benchmarks/history_compaction_benchmark.md`


## Research
For architecture/design thinking, explore `research/`.

This includes case-study style notes about external companies I find interesting, based only on publicly available information:
- I have no affiliation with these companies and no inside information.
- I keep this separate from employer work so I can share freely without extra internal process or verification and without worrying about accidentally including non-public information.

## Navigation
- Projects index: `projects/README.md`
